  	<h3 id="apples-value-ever-since-its-renaissance-has-relied-on-a-tightly-integrated-ecosystem">Apple’s value ever since its Renaissance has relied on a tightly integrated Ecosystem</h3>

<p>The iPod wouldn’t have been a phenomenon without the iTunes Store. The iPad wouldn’t have sold as much as it did without the iPhone and their shared apps and services. And now OSX is getting closer than ever to iOS with the release of Yosemite.</p>

<p>However, Apple’s revenue model is still mainly based on their Hardware. Sure, by now it’s impossible to consider the iPhone without iOS in mind, and the OS deserves much of the praise for the success of Apple has had in the last few years.</p>

<p>Still, between…</p>

<ul>
  <li>OSX</li>
  <li>iOS</li>
  <li>iTunes</li>
  <li>iTunes (the Store)</li>
  <li>iTunes (the Radio)</li>
  <li>Appstore (for iOS)</li>
  <li>Appstore (for OSX)</li>
  <li>Safari (for both)</li>
  <li>iCloud</li>
  <li>iBooks</li>
  <li>Newsstand</li>
  <li>Game Center</li>
  <li>iLife</li>
  <li>iWork</li>
  <li>Health</li>
  <li>Final Cut Pro</li>
  <li>Logic Pro</li>
  <li>A brand new programming language</li>
</ul>

<p>… and a <em>miniaturized wrist watch Computer</em>, it’s a lot to juggle. At US$ 170 billion revenue and 98,000 employees, one has to wonder how much more can Apple grow without wearing itself thin even further.</p>

<h4 id="lets-face-it-a-bunch-of-apple-apps-suck">Let’s face it: a bunch of Apple apps suck</h4>

<p>That’s not hard to demonstrate. Just grab someone’s iPhone to see their default apps. Are they using Mail or Gmail? iTunes Radio or Spotify? iCloud or Dropbox?</p>

<p>Setting secondary defaults will hardly ever happen, as it directly undermines Apple’s business strategy by devaluing their ecosystem. Sure, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/explaining-ios-8s-extensions-opening-the-platform-while-keeping-it-secure/">they’ve added Extensions</a>, but their cautious approach<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> shows how little they are willing to concede their dominance. In light of <em>The Default Apps</em>, the massive usage Mail.app has is not so different from the one IE used to have long ago.</p>

<p>It can be said that it’s not Apple’s goal to make you use every single default app on iOS, and that’s probably true. But use enough Google products on your iPhone, and you suddenly aren’t as commited to their ecosystem as they wish you were.</p>

<h4 id="boo-hoo-mom-insists-on-using-these-terrible-apps">Boo hoo, Mom insists on using these terrible apps!</h4>

<p>Far from being a “default app” problem, this is a system-wide issue that affects Apple and their relations with content producers and developers.</p>

<p>Newsstand, the platform that was supposed to showcase the iPad’s power and might, is crumbling: not only their “killer app” <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/3/3721544/the-daily-ipad-news-mag-shutdown-december-15th">died eons ago</a>, but their indie darling <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/299139/9-hard-lessons-top-ipad-publisher/">is closing doors as well</a>. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Appstore is overrun by clones of popular apps like a horde of Orcs climbing the castle’s walls — and iOS development is <a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93118460565/a-candid-look-at-unreads-first-year">no</a> <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/07/28/more_on_ios_indies">longer</a> <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2014/07/30/the-plight-of-the-indie-ios-developer-is-the-app-store-broken-o/">as</a> <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/07/28/more_on_ios_indies">sustainable</a> as it once was. </p>

<p>Sure, maybe it’s the market that’s changing. But it may also be that the App Store’s information architecture and discoverability are bad to the point of jeopardizing the work done by Apple and iOS Developers in the past 6 years.</p>

<h3 id="maybe-apple-should-buy-twitter">“Maybe Apple should buy Twitter”</h3>

<p>This odd, yet fairly sensible <a href="http://patrickbgibson.com/post/36041799210/apple-and-twitter">argument from 2012</a> still holds ground today, in the sense that Apple is still <em>not</em> a Web Services company.</p>

<p>From the smoldering failure that was MobileMe rose <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4148628/why-doesnt-icloud-just-work">a headache called iCloud</a> that culminated in one of Apple’s biggest PR and Security fiascos of all time.</p>

<p>Apple Maps? Tim Cook issued a public apology and <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/apple-fires-maps-manager/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">fired</a> the manager responsible for it.</p>

<p>And Siri, the service that was released in iOS with a Beta tag is… well, is just <a href="http://dcurt.is/voice-interfaces">not there yet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="its-a-hard-job">It’s a hard job</h3>

<p>Mantaining such a wide ecosystem of apps and web services is a task that no one else carries out as well as Apple, hence their dominance of the mobile market. </p>

<p>Still, their hardware release schedule is <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2014/10/11/apples-software-quality-decline/">pushing the limits</a> of how fast they can improve their software ecosystem, and no ammount of extra engineers and designers will be able to fix this conundrum. I mean when you get to 100,000 employees, that should be more than enough to handle it. Who knows.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s time for iOS and Apple to get back to basics.</p>
