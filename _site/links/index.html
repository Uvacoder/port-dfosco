              <div class="card-note__description"><p>Designer and artist Jaclyn Leneé is on a 100-day stretch doing a color palette everyday based on a different picture. See all of her palettes so far <a href="http://100daysofcolor.tumblr.com/?ref=danielfosco-linklist">on her Tumblr</a>.</p>

<p><em>~~Update~~</em></p>

<p>I reached out to Jaclyn <a href="https://twitter.com/jaclynlenee">on Twitter</a> to ask a couple of questions about her inspiration and feelings around the project — see below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What’s your process for coming up with the color palette for each photograph?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Jaclyn</strong>: I’m delighted by color in everyday life. I snap photos of subjects and textures I find beautiful, and pull colors from them.</p>

  <p><strong>How does this project relates to the way you use color in your design work?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Jaclyn:</strong> I frequently look online for color inspiration. Since I started this project, I’ve pulled from my own palettes. It is satisfying to design with my own color stories, rather than use a palette from Kuler, or elsewhere.</p>

  <p><strong>Do you expect things to get… repetitive by the 100th day? How do you look for new subjects and/or diff results?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Jaclyn:</strong> I doubt it. Every image is different, the lighting different, the subject different. Endless possibilities. It is all about opening my eyes to the world around me. I take a lot of walks and keep my eyes peeled for color and texture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d like to thank Jaclyn for taking the time to answer these questions – great insights for anyone who wants to dive deeper into working with color <i class="twa twa-lg twa-smiley"></i></p>

<p>Personal project or not, writing CSS with BEM makes class-naming much more constrained (and well-documented), pushing you to write styling and markup in a more structured manner.</p>

<p>If you’ve never heard of BEM, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">this article</a> by CSS-Tricks is another great way to get started.</p>

  <p>I can’t deny that Slack has a nicer aesthetic than HipChat. It does look nice and it is fun to use. But here’s the thing — a lot of nicely designed products never take off or get noticed. Good design is not enough. There are so many pieces to consider and things you have to nail to get a product out ahead of the pack.</p>

  <p>Here’s my list.</p>

<p>A great follow-up to <a href="http://danielfos.co/links/slacks-2-8-billion-dollar-secret-sauce">Andrew Wilkinson’s piece</a> about Slack and its secret sauce — both have their merits, and both are right to a certain extent.</p>

A great transition in a mobile app gives us the same feeling we get from using a well-made door handle on a solid oak door — you may not be able to put your finger on it, but man, does the house ever feel well built.

<blockquote>
  <p>In all, aside from making people roll their eyes at me, the biggest impact of having this absurdly distended online network is that it makes my online life really weird. The weirdness is probably best demonstrated by a few of the recurring conversations that arise as a result:</p>

  <p><strong>“Yo, can you listen to my mixtape?”</strong> This is perhaps the most frequent side effect of having a lot of followers: People think there must be a reason people follow me, and assume I can do something for them as a result.</p>

  <p>(…)</p>

  <p><strong>“Kill yourself!”</strong> If you have a lot of followers online, and especially if you have the temerity to do so while being a woman and/or a minority of some sort , you’ll often just face waves of harassment and abuse, regardless of how innocuous your statements are. I’d talk more about this, and what the social networks could do to fix things, but then the GamerGate hordes will just show up and start sending threats again, and ughhhhh who has the time? (…)</p>
