              <div class="link-box__description"><blockquote>
  <p><strong>Introducing Marvel UX Testing Tools Beta</strong><br />
We’re introducing some incredible tools that will allow you to get in-depth insights into how users interact with your prototypes including:</p>

  <p>Screen recordings of users moving through your prototype<br />
Indicators of where users tapped or clicked on each screen<br />
User reactions via audio and video feedback as they use your prototype<br />
Ability to share test results with your team and stakeholders</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the past 3 years or so, a lot of prototyping tools popped up in the market, with Marvel and InVision being the leaders in the <em>export-your-png-assets-and-link-them-with-hotspots</em> category.</p>

<p>InVision has been paving the way with an extensive feature-set, being the first to offer Dropbox integration, automatic Sketch import, as well as the only one to add a <em>Google Hangouts</em> style live-call for remote user testing (which is absolutely fantastic).</p>

<p>Marvel, on the other hand, has been on its own feature-spree the past few months: just after releasing prototype annotations and a Sketch import plugin, they now announced this beta for screen &amp; front-camera recording — which, without jumping to early conclusions, seems to be a killer feature.</p>

<p>Not only that, but this kind of feature ties in pretty closely to one of the most pressing needs of user testing: hell, if you’re giving me prototyping tools, might as well make it easier to record and evaluate my test results.</p>

<p>InVision, with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/invision-2">$35m in funding</a> rolling in since early 2012, had a good head start, but Marvel’s <em>mere</em> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/marvel">$900k</a> raised last year is clearly being put to good use by their team.</p>

<p>Considering the gigantic difference in funding they have, Marvel is kicking some serious Invision ass — while also raising the question of “perhaps you shouldn’t take <strong>35 million dollars</strong> in funding for a freaking prototyping tool?”.</p>

<p>But then again, who am I to say how one should or should not run their company? Although Fred Wilson provides a compelling argument for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_tjoQmf5g">why raising too much capital can be a bad thing</a>.</p>

The poor will pay by surrendering their data</h2></a>
              
              
              <div class="link-box__description"><p>Here’s Evgeny Morozov (<a href="https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov">@evgenymorozov</a>) destroying Facebook and Google’s ambition to “spread connectivity across the globe” in a single blow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Facebook, Google’s closest competitor, pulls the same trick with connectivity. Its Internet.org initiative, which now operates in Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa, was ostensibly launched to promote digital inclusion and get the poor in the developing world online. Online they do get but it’s a very particular kind of “online”: Facebook and a few other sites and apps are free but users have to pay for everything else, often based on how much data their individual apps consume. As a result, few of these people – remember, we are talking about very poor populations – are likely to afford the world outside Facebook’s content empire.</p>

  <p>Here is the Varian rule at work again: on the face of it, the poor do get what the rich have already – internet connectivity. But the key difference is not hard to spot. Unlike the rich, who pay for their connectivity with their cash, the poor pay for it with their data – the data that Facebook would one day monetise in order to justify the entire Internet.org operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google’s chief economist, Hal Varian, has such narrow-minded logic it could make someone think he’s overlooking some “details” in good faith, but when the “details” are the economic reality of 2/3 of the people in the globe, it makes very clear what’s behind the bullshit of his <span class="quote">“Luxury is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed”</span>: a desire to profit on top of people that have much less than you do, providing the same service the western-white-middle-class world already has, for much much more.</p>

              <div class="link-box__description"><blockquote>
  <p>When Tidal made its big media push at the end of March, the core message was clear: while other streaming music services like Spotify and Pandora pay a pittance to artists, Tidal offers musicians a better deal. Unfortunately, Tidal also opted to use super stars like Nicki Minaj and Beyonce as spokespersons for the app. The result was the ultimate mixed message: You should feel sorry about how little money Nicki makes.</p>

<p>Spot on analysis of why hardly anybody gives a crap about Tidal.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEsJqtiU-2A">humorous video</a> also drives the point home pretty well.</p>

  <p>Learning to design is, first of all, learning to see. Designers see more, and more precisely. This is a blessing and a curse—once we have learned to see design, both good and bad, we cannot un-see. The downside is that the more you learn to see, the more you lose your “common” eye, the eye you design for. […]</p>

  <p>This is why excellent designers do not just develop a sharper eye. They try to keep their ability to see things as a customer would. You need a design eye to design, and a non-designer eye to feel what you designed.</p>

  <p>“See with one eye, feel with the other.” —Paul Klee</p>
