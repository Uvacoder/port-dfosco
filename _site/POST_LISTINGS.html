            <blockquote><p>Learning to design is, first of all, learning to see. Designers see more, and more precisely. This is a blessing and a curse—once we have learned to see design, both good and bad, we cannot un-see. The downside is that the more you learn to see, the more you lose your “common” eye, the eye you design for. [...]</p>

            <p>This is why excellent designers do not just develop a sharper eye. They try to keep their ability to see things as a customer would. You need a design eye to design, and a non-designer eye to feel what you designed.</p>

            <p>This small tidbit serves as the perfect example to his argument — overheard at a recent New York Times editorial meeting:</p>
            <blockquote class="link-description">[...] When the conversation turns to a vivid story from Liberia, where Ebola has overtaken a particular neighborhood in Monrovia, one editor proudly reports that she believes the Times is the only outlet with a reporter on the ground, which makes everyone happy until another editor says, “I think BuzzFeed actually has somebody there.” There is momentary silence.

            <p>A bad survey won’t tell you it’s bad. It’s actually really hard to find out that a bad survey is bad — or to tell whether you have written a good or bad set of questions. [...]</p>

            <p>Surveys are usually the easiest way to gather “relevant” user feedback, but it's easy to see how they can be used to cop out of <i>really</i> listening to your users.</p>

            <p>Not saying surveys are now forever banned as good practices of user research, but when Erika Hall is saying stuff like this, you tread carefully at the very least.</p>

            </a>
            <p>This week, a dress broke the internet (with the help of two llamas), yielding BuzzFeed <i class="twa twa-lg twa-zap"></i><i>28 million</i><i class="twa twa-lg twa-zap"></i> pageviews for a single article in less than 24 hours — and leaving traditional media shuffling their feet trying not to miss the tsunami.</p>

            <p>Paul Ford <a href="https://medium.com/message/yes-to-the-dress-5ec06c06aca4" target="_blank">on Medium</a> tries to understand the reasons behind the dress's success and the consequences it will bring to newsrooms around the globe:</p>

            <blockquote>I know from experience that Internet events like this have consequences. Meetings. Memos. Jealousy. Twenty-five million [at the time of publication] is a number to make an editorial director angry. [...] <i>How do I get that? They’ll wonder. How do I get that sweet, sweet traffic? Why do those children get the traffic with frolic while my attempts to go viral fall flat at hundreds of thousands of impressions?</i></blockquote>

            <p>Brian Morrissey echoes a similar feeling <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/its-white-and-gold-dummy/" target="_blank">on Digiday</a> and proclaims that “Buzzfeed won”:</p>

            <blockquote>In this game, BuzzFeed is winning. It must boggle the mind at traditional publishers that seemingly the entire Internet is talking about content that was created not by a seasoned reporter but a “community growth manager.” These so-called premium publishing brands will inevitably lose their pricing power in the ad market as they continue to copy BuzzFeed.</blockquote>
            
            <p>With a massive audience that's becoming bigger and wider every day, solid “news” coverage, an experimental app development team and a friggin' movie studio, Buzzfeed is shaping up to be the media company of the future.</p>

            <p class="link-description">The New Yorker profiles Jony Ive — a good read, albeit a bit long. Worth skimming at least.</p>

            <p>Lots of insight on Apple's design process, but this quote takes the cake for <em>most amusing</em>:</p>

            <blockquote><p>Ive once sat next to J. J. Abrams at a boozy dinner party in New York, and made what Abrams recalled as “very specific” suggestions about the design of lightsabres.</p>

              <p>“I thought it would be interesting if it were less precise, and just a little bit more spitty.” A redesigned weapon could be “more analog and more primitive, and I think, in that way, somehow more ominous.”</p></blockquote>

            <blockquote class="link-description">
              <p>Everything you feel, smell, and see is leaping onto the Internet, just as everything is becoming a camera. A Really Good Camera. Perhaps your naked image is already on a neighbor’s Dropcam, which happened to see in your window as you walked past without any pants on. (...) The nudes are out there.</p>

              <p>We just have to stop caring about other people’s nudity. We should quit being shocked, and we should quit being shamed, because the shame is not ours, only the genitals are. And your genitals are wonderful. You should show them to the world.</p>

            <p class="link-description">Great article by Andrew Wilkinson about the importance of building a small-scale business that provides value to a small number of customers.<p>

            <p>On the same note, <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/unsustainable-companies.html" target="_blank">Jason Cohen's article</a> from 2012 highlights the perils of "successful unsustainable" companies, while <a href="http://freddestin.com/2013/11/snapchat-revenues-debate.html" target="_blank">Fred Destin's article</a> from 2013 does pretty much the opposite, in a fantastic defense of Snapchat and similar companies with no revenue or an apparent business model.</p>
