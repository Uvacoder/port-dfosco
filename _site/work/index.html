<p>The Circular App protoype was created during the 2-day Hackaton promoted by the SESI institute for its event Semana de Cultura Digital (Digital Culture Week).</p>

<p>Our project is a way to connect people that wanted to donate itens to people that needed them. The interface consists of a feed of available itens, a way to post a new item and a chat window to define when and where to pick it up.</p>

<p>The starting point was the event “Feira Grátis da Gratidão”, a weekly freecycling meetup in Rio de Janeiro where people donate and exchange their stuff.</p>

<p>The main medium of communication for the participants is a Facebook group where itens are offered, but it’s riddled with problems – as a public forum, users frequently disagree over who should receive a donation and moderation has an awful lot of work to do.</p>

<p>With the hackaton on course, we sent a quick survey to the administrators of the group to get better insight into their daily operation. Reading through hundreds of messages on the group’s feed also helped defining the problem.</p>

<p>Thus, we arrived at the critical pain points that the app should solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Make the donation experience effortless for the person giving the item</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Decrease overall frustration by matching the right users</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The first point was achieved by a semi-anonymous interface: in the app, the user donating the item only appears after she selects a user that will receive the donation, avoiding the headaches that happen in the Facebook group.</p>

<p>The second point happens by ordering the feed of itens algorithmically and giving priority the ones closer to you (either geographically or by facebook connections).</p>

<p>The prototype is no longer available, but here are some of the main screens designed during the hackaton:</p>

<p><img src="plotter.png" alt="This is a cutting plotter" /></p>

<p>After a few years doing web design and digital marketing for them, we figured it was time to have an e-commerce to have direct online sales — and also to replace the terrible website they had before… made by myself, of course<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This project was done in collaboration with designer and photographer Luisa Fosco<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> — without her superb photography and graphic design skillset, the site wouldn’t be half of what it is.</p>

<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Shopify</li>
</ul>

<p>Shopify is an emotional roller-coaster — a great platform to work with, but full of frustrating constraints.</p>

<p>While it’s great not having to deal with PHP and local databases<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, it all comes at a price: Jekyll has abysmal support for custom post types, gateway support in Brazil is severely lacking and their themes force you to keep all of your SCSS in a single monster file (unless you have a build system in place). Oh, and local development is unavailable <i class="twa twa-grin"></i>.</p>

<p>It is <em>so</em> worth it, though. All of these problems are met by theme developers — merchants have it really easy with Shopify. Their admin dashboard is thoroughly well designed — from media uploads to pricing updates, to email notifications. All of these would add up to a ton of work if they had to be prepares outside of Shopify.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information Architecture</li>
</ul>

<p>We conducted interviews with sales and support teams and delved deep into support tickets to figure out the needs, the language and the modelling the products should have on the new site.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graphic Design</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though developing the site theme (based on Shopify’s Timber framework) was a huge amount of work, the base graphic design work done by Luisa was essential to make a pattern library to support further phases of the project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Snooping on your Users to make their lives better</li>
</ul>

<p>Hotjar was an essential tool in iterating the design early on — seeing a playback of users visiting your site makes it so much easier to uncover roadblocks in your user flow.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build &amp; Deploy</li>
</ul>

<p>Although asset handling in Shopify is dismal, I have to commend them for the command-line interface that made my life so much easier. Using Dploy.io towards the end of the development also easened a burden and allowed me to develop exclusively on a <code>dev</code> branch that deploys to a dummy store and then send it to production on the press of a button — no more breaking changes on the live site. Next step would be to add Gulp to the workflow to make asset handling more sane, but one thing at a time…</p>

<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>

<p>While visitor engagement and overall leads went up, the online sales never really took off… which is a bit disappointing, but also clear when looking in retrospect.</p>

<p>One reason for that might be the average ticket — a product starting at around $1000, is a bit too high for a traditional e-commerce setting.</p>

<p>It may also be that, due to the highly specialized and technical nature of the product, more brand recognition is needed for a direct sale online without contact with a sales rep.</p>

<p>We are currently investigating options — while plan A is to gradually improve the site keeping metrics along the way, another possibility is to dump Shopify altogether and just keep the site as an online catalogue and lead generator for the products.</p>

In the (fictional) brief, Instagram needed a way to diversify their revenue stream and needed a new printing feature to be developed.</p>

<p>The team for this project was really tight-knit, and the process was a big exercise in participatory design, from user research to prototyping.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the project, my role shifted to assembling the app prototype using Axure, which you can play around with <a href="http://y9d00x.axshare.com/#c=2" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="competitive-analysis-user-research-and-affinity-mapping">Competitive analysis, User Research and Affinity Mapping</h4>

<p>We set our core concept as an expansion of Instagram’s brand into the real world by connecting Instagram into the old way of sharing — through printing and gifting pictures.</p>

<p>A survey, combined with several rounds of user interviews, allowed us to understand the users’ photo printing needs and Instagram usage habits.</p>

<p>Competitive research showed pain-points of competitors and highlighted one of our main value propositions: <strong>being able to print your friends’ pictures</strong>.</p>

<p>Research results were aggregated in an affinity map, to prioritize user needs and features, which was then used to build three personas for the project.</p>

<h4 id="storyboarding-and-user-flows">Storyboarding and User Flows</h4>

<p>A quick storyboarding session helped to shape the first user flows and made clear how the user would move through the new feature in order to print their pictures.</p>

<p>The flows were complemented by an overview of the new feature in comparison to the rest of app’s architecture.</p>

<h3 id="interaction-design">Interaction Design</h3>

<h4 id="sketching-testing-prototyping-testing-testing">Sketching, Testing, Prototyping, Testing, Testing</h4>

<p>Early sketches were done in group on the whiteboard, as a way to get the team on the same page and define initial expectations for the interface.</p>

<p>These were followed by several batches of rough wireframes that solidified the idea we had for the interface and allowed us to move forward to user testing.</p>

</section>
<p><img src="/assets/img/interaction_design_3.png" alt="Paper Prototyping" /></p>

<p>Doing tests with paper prototypes allowed us to sketch, test and incorporate feedback much faster than going straight to digital.</p>

<p>Product selection and checkout screens were specially challenging, interface-wise: our first version had too much information density, while further down the road we over-simplified. Only through several iterations and a lot of testing we found the right balance.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/interaction_design_4.png" alt="User Testing" /></p>

<p>When we were ready to move forward, the team finished the final mockups, while I prepared the interactive prototype using Axure – which included mimicking some of Instagram’s native interactions, as pictured below.</p>

<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>

<h4 id="design-at-close-quarters">Design at close quarters</h4>

<p>The deadline was tough, but the close-knit teamwork and the test-driven approach enabled us to achieve great results in a short ammount of time.</p>

<p>Loads of testing allowed us to constantly fix our assumptions, while having the team in sync meant better feedback — and thus, a better design output.</p>

<p>Swerve is a indoor cycling studio in Manhattan with a unique approach: their indoor bikes come equipped with a performance tracker that groups students into three teams that compete amongst each other every class.</p>

<p>Our focus with this prototype was to allow Swerve users to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Book classes with ease in their mobile phones</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Visualize their performance stats in a dedicated interface</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For this, we performed an industry-wide research that included interviews with fitness users and specialists, in-depth surveys, detailed analysis of the competition’s offerings and <em>lots</em> of spinning classes.</p>

<p>This research was instrumental in guiding our iterative process of sketching, testing and prototyping — and resulted in a final product that addressed user needs and respected the existing systems at Swerve.</p>

<p>The final result of our work is the <strong>interactive prototype</strong> you can see below. The client also received a 16-page research report to be used as a boilerplate for future projects.</p>

<hr />

<p>Finally, I can’t help but mention that this project would never have been successful without the talented <a href="http://www.ashtonoconnor.com/" targe="_blank">Ashton O’Connor</a> and <a href="http://alfredoachecar.com/" target="_blank">Alfredo Achecar</a> on the team.</p>

<p>Much of the project’s quality is due either to Ashton’s obsessive UI Design skills and Alfredo’s tireless leadership and research. The late nights and crazy hours were a pleasure with these two around.</p>
