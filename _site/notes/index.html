              <div class="card__description"><p>Khoi Vinh and the Adobe Team took a bunch of designers for breakfast and asked them about the tools they use. The results, albeit unscientific, still bring terrific insights — such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prototyping is the Wild West. Every team we met with uses a variety of prototyping tools, whether Pixate, Marvel, InVision, Flinto or others. There seems to be little if any standardization; as new tools emerge and teams find that they offer new advantages, designers readily adopt them and set others aside. There’s a feeling that this space has lots of growth and evolution ahead of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can you demonstrate the value of design games, or collaborative moodboard exercises? Or that it took six months of negotiating with dozens of facets of an organisation in order for a content strategy to be adopted? My advice would be to write a story. Show photographs of workshops. Demonstrate how you approach these things. List the methods you’ve used and those that have worked. List those that haven’t and the reasons why.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>Emily Guendelsberger goes undercover as an Uber driver in Philadelphia to figure out how deep the rabbit hole goes — and comes out of it with a 6000-word article, sprinkled with moments like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Passenger</strong>: So what’s Uber like? I hear you can make a ton of money!</p>

  <p><strong>Emily</strong>: Yeah, not really — when they take UberX into a new market like Philly, they start off by paying drivers a lot. So in the beginning, you get a lot of drivers who look like the drivers in Uber ads, like, suits and bottled water and no accents. And everyone gets the idea that Uber drivers have suits and make a ton of money. Then after a while, usually when a competitor comes in — you know Lyft just started up a couple weeks ago, right?</p>

  <p><strong>Passenger</strong>: Yeah …</p>

  <p><strong>Emily</strong>: So then Uber cuts fares down by, like, a lot. Like, here, they just cut fares almost in half. So most of those initial drivers quit and are replaced by people willing to work for the lower amount, who are the same people who used to drive cabs. They’re just doing it for a new boss, for less money and no tips, and they’re carrying most of the liability themselves. But most riders never change that first impression that drivers make a lot of money.</p>

  <p><strong>Passenger</strong>: … Oh, uh, OK.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>Designer and artist Jaclyn Leneé is on a 100-day stretch doing a color palette everyday based on a different picture. See all of her palettes so far <a href="http://100daysofcolor.tumblr.com/?ref=danielfosco-linklist">on her Tumblr</a>.</p>

<p><em>~~Update~~</em></p>

<p>I reached out to Jaclyn <a href="https://twitter.com/jaclynlenee">on Twitter</a> to ask a couple of questions about her inspiration and feelings around the project — see below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What’s your process for coming up with the color palette for each photograph?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Jaclyn</strong>: I’m delighted by color in everyday life. I snap photos of subjects and textures I find beautiful, and pull colors from them.</p>

  <p><strong>How does this project relates to the way you use color in your design work?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Jaclyn:</strong> I frequently look online for color inspiration. Since I started this project, I’ve pulled from my own palettes. It is satisfying to design with my own color stories, rather than use a palette from Kuler, or elsewhere.</p>

  <p><strong>Do you expect things to get… repetitive by the 100th day? How do you look for new subjects and/or diff results?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Jaclyn:</strong> I doubt it. Every image is different, the lighting different, the subject different. Endless possibilities. It is all about opening my eyes to the world around me. I take a lot of walks and keep my eyes peeled for color and texture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d like to thank Jaclyn for taking the time to answer these questions – great insights for anyone who wants to dive deeper into working with color <i class="twa twa twa-smiley"></i></p>

<p>Personal project or not, writing CSS with BEM makes class-naming much more constrained (and well-documented), pushing you to write styling and markup in a more structured manner.</p>

<p>If you’ve never heard of BEM, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">this article</a> by CSS-Tricks is another great way to get started.</p>

  <p>Like a well-built home, great software focuses on giving its users hundreds of small, satisfying interactions. A great transition in a mobile app gives us the same feeling we get from using a well-made door handle on a solid oak door — you may not be able to put your finger on it, but man, does the house ever feel well built. Slack is really fun to use. It feels like a well-built house.</p>

  <p>In all, aside from making people roll their eyes at me, the biggest impact of having this absurdly distended online network is that it makes my online life really weird. The weirdness is probably best demonstrated by a few of the recurring conversations that arise as a result:</p>

  <p><strong>“Yo, can you listen to my mixtape?”</strong> This is perhaps the most frequent side effect of having a lot of followers: People think there must be a reason people follow me, and assume I can do something for them as a result.</p>

  <p>(…)</p>

  <p><strong>“Kill yourself!”</strong> If you have a lot of followers online, and especially if you have the temerity to do so while being a woman and/or a minority of some sort , you’ll often just face waves of harassment and abuse, regardless of how innocuous your statements are. I’d talk more about this, and what the social networks could do to fix things, but then the GamerGate hordes will just show up and start sending threats again, and ughhhhh who has the time? (…)</p>

              <div class="card__description"><blockquote>
  <p><strong>Introducing Marvel UX Testing Tools Beta</strong><br />
We’re introducing some incredible tools that will allow you to get in-depth insights into how users interact with your prototypes including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Screen recordings of users moving through your prototype</li>
    <li>Indicators of where users tapped or clicked on each screen</li>
    <li>User reactions via audio and video feedback as they use your prototype</li>
    <li>Ability to share test results with your team and stakeholders</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For the past 3 years or so, a lot of prototyping tools popped up in the market, with Marvel and InVision being the leaders in the <em>export-your-png-assets-and-link-them-with-hotspots</em> category.</p>

<p>InVision has been paving the way with an extensive feature-set, being the first to offer Dropbox integration, automatic Sketch import, as well as the only one to add a <em>Google Hangouts</em> style live-call for remote user testing (it’s absolutely fantastic).</p>

<p>Marvel, on the other hand, has been on its own feature-spree the past few months: just after releasing prototype annotations and a Sketch import plugin, they now announced this beta for screen &amp; front-camera recording — which, without jumping to early conclusions, seems to be a killer feature.</p>

<p>Not only that, but this kind of feature ties in pretty closely to one of the most pressing needs of user testing: hell, if you’re giving me prototyping tools, might as well make it easier to record and evaluate my test results.</p>

<p>InVision, with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/invision-2">$35m in funding</a> rolling in since early 2012, had a good head start, but Marvel’s <em>mere</em> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/marvel">$900k</a> raised last year is clearly being put to good use by their team.</p>

<p>Considering the gigantic difference in funding they have, Marvel is kicking some serious Invision ass — while also raising the question of “perhaps you shouldn’t take <strong>35 million dollars</strong> in funding for a freaking prototyping tool?”.</p>

<p>But then again, who am I to say how one should or should not run their company? Although Fred Wilson provides a compelling argument for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_tjoQmf5g">why raising too much capital can be a bad thing</a>.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>Here‘s Evgeny Morozov (<a href="https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov">@evgenymorozov</a>) destroying Facebook and Google’s ambition to “spread connectivity across the globe” in a single blow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Facebook, Google’s closest competitor, pulls the same trick with connectivity. Its Internet.org initiative, which now operates in Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa, was ostensibly launched to promote digital inclusion and get the poor in the developing world online. Online they do get but it’s a very particular kind of “online”: Facebook and a few other sites and apps are free but users have to pay for everything else, often based on how much data their individual apps consume. As a result, few of these people – remember, we are talking about very poor populations – are likely to afford the world outside Facebook’s content empire.</p>

  <p>Here is the Varian rule at work again: on the face of it, the poor do get what the rich have already – internet connectivity. But the key difference is not hard to spot. Unlike the rich, who pay for their connectivity with their cash, the poor pay for it with their data – the data that Facebook would one day monetise in order to justify the entire Internet.org operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google‘s chief economist, Hal Varian, has such narrow-minded logic it could make someone think he’s overlooking some “details” in good faith, but when the “details” are the economic reality of 2/3 of the people in the globe, it makes very clear what’s behind the bullshit of his <span class="quote">“Luxury is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed”</span>: a desire to profit on top of people that have much less than you do, providing the same service the western-white-middle-class world already has, for much much more.</p>

  <p>When Tidal made its big media push at the end of March, the core message was clear: while other streaming music services like Spotify and Pandora pay a pittance to artists, Tidal offers musicians a better deal. Unfortunately, Tidal also opted to use super stars like Nicki Minaj and Beyonce as spokespersons for the app. The result was the ultimate mixed message: You should feel sorry about how little money Nicki makes.</p>

  <p>Learning to design is, first of all, learning to see. Designers see more, and more precisely. This is a blessing and a curse—once we have learned to see design, both good and bad, we cannot un-see. The downside is that the more you learn to see, the more you lose your “common” eye, the eye you design for. […]</p>

  <p>This is why excellent designers do not just develop a sharper eye. They try to keep their ability to see things as a customer would. You need a design eye to design, and a non-designer eye to feel what you designed.</p>

  <p>When I checked the documentation for HealthKit […] I was disappointed to find out that Apple did not include anything related to menstruation and the reproductive health of roughly half of the world’s population.</p>

  <p>In case you’re wondering whether Health is only concerned with a few basics: Apple has predicted the need to input data about blood oxygen saturation, <strong>your daily molybdenum or pathogenic acid intake, cycling distance, number of times fallen and your electrodermal activity</strong>, but nothing to do with recording information about your menstrual cycle.</p>

<p>This small tidbit serves as the perfect example to his argument — overheard at a recent New York Times editorial meeting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] When the conversation turns to a vivid story from Liberia, where Ebola has overtaken a particular neighborhood in Monrovia, one editor proudly reports that she believes the Times is the only outlet with a reporter on the ground, which makes everyone happy until another editor says, “I think BuzzFeed actually has somebody there.” There is momentary silence.</p>
