<p>Writing code is hard. For every 1 minute of bliss typing characters in the computer and seeing it render things that didn’t exist before, there are 10 minutes of frustration with unreadable code and bugs that didn’t exist the night before.</p>

<p>Writing code with Git is hard. Writing code without it is <em>unthinkable</em>. Whether you’re senior developer on a huge team or a designer who just started dabbling with front-end for personal projects, using Git will change the way you code for the best and make group collaboration enjoyable.</p>

<p>This guide will walk you through basic concepts in Git with some hands-on action at the end. It won’t make you a Git master, but you will be able to use Git by yourself with <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> and it’s <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">desktop app</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PSA:</strong> This is a guide for <em>absolute beginners</em>… if you already have Git chops feel free to skim through or jump to the references in the end of the article.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-git">What is Git</h3>

<p><strong>Git is a distributed version-control system for code.</strong></p>

<p>Descriptive but not very helpful, right? Let me tell you a true story then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re working on a small website. You’ve been trying to get that sticky footer right for a whole hour and somehow only managed to make it worse in the process. It’s 2AM. You hate CSS and is currently in the process of re-thinking your life choices. Screw this, <strong>let’s go back to the previous version from 3 hours ago **and watch some Netflix.</strong></p>

  <p>Oh wait.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>previous version</em>. You don’t have it anymore, do you?</p>

<p>What if <strong>every change in your project was tracked — every character and line of code you added or deleted.</strong> What if you could save <em>all</em> of your code at every stage of your work?</p>

<p>That way, once you started working on the <em>feature/sticky-footer</em>, you were sure nothing would be lost if you decided to roll back — and you could even go back to work on this feature later if you wanted to.</p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/3054/1*jVgsyj1LdsBdraPmjczCcQ.png" alt="**Git is a time machine for code**" /></p>

<p><cite><strong>Git is a time machine for code</strong></cite></p>

<p>That’s what Git does. It tracks and saves <strong>snapshots of your entire codebase</strong> and allows you to easily distribute it to other developers (either teammates or people on the internet). In practice, Git will allow you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Roll-back changes in your code</li>
  <li>Develop new features without affecting code that’s already live</li>
  <li>Collaborate with other developers <em>in the same code at the same time</em> without going insane</li>
  <li>Make it <em>really hard</em> to screw things up</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="but-what-about-github">But what about… Github?</h3>

<p>This can be confusing for beginners, so let’s clear it up.</p>

<p>Git is an open-source system. You use it by running it on your machine to save your code and then upload it to a server where other people can see it. The thing is, for this to work you have to install Git on this server and manage it yourself. Which, as you probably guessed, <em>is a major pain in the ass</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com">Github</a> was created to address this problem. It’s a platform that hosts your code on a remote Git server with a nice web interface and allows you to collaborate with other project members on the same server. Conversely, the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github app</a> can be used instead of the default Git command-line application on your desktop.</p>

<p>There are others similar platforms like <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> — they are great products as well. Github became huge for its interface focused on team collaboration and massive adoption by the open-source community.</p>

<p>For the sake of convention we’re going to use Github for this guide, but the same could be achieved using other hosted platforms.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p>When you use Git, your project lives in a <strong>repository</strong>. Every project is a repository, and every repository has a different history — basically, a timeline of every change you saved in it.</p>

<p>However, Git doesn’t save changes to the history automatically. To save a change to your history, you need to <strong>commit</strong> your changes.</p>

<p>The commit is the most important thing about Git. <em>Comitting</em> is the way to add a file or save changed files to your repository history.</p>

<p>A commit represents a snapshot of your repository in the moment that commit was saved — <em>all of your repository, with every file, all of it</em>.</p>

<p>You can type a message for each of your commits, describing which changes it’s saving to the project’s history. It’s important to keep your commit messages descriptive and short. <strong>Never commit without writing a commit message.</strong></p>

<p>Committing is a powerful tool. It allows you think about your code in chunks and organizes your work — each small part of your work is done and checked in a commit before moving to the next.</p>

<p>There are other important things to know, but let’s do this <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="getting-our-hands-dirty">Getting our hands dirty</h3>

<p>Let’s create a repository and do a test commit. Start by creating a <a href="https://github.com/join">Github account</a> if you don’t have one already.</p>

<p>Once you do, create a new repository. You can name it however you want, this is just a test. Leave other configurations untouched for now.</p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*HDE73R4sU--weNaEJrEWnA.png" alt="Pretty straightforward" />
<cite><em>Pretty straightforward</em></cite></p>

<p>You’ve probably seen people using Git with the command-line. It’s easy to do it, but don’t worry, we’ll skip the command-line for now. We will use <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github’s desktop app</a> that achieves the same purpose with a helpful UI for Windows or Mac.</p>

<p>Once your repository was created at Github and you have the Desktop app up and running, you’ll see it listed in the app. Now you need to copy it to your machine.</p>

<p>That is, you need to <strong>clone</strong> it. The app will give you the option to select a folder where the repository will live in your computer: that’s where your code should go.</p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/5116/1*w4kz4AuqKc0HRGJpPN4fsg.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="saving-your-changes">Saving your changes</h3>

<p>Once you have your repo (short for repository) cloned, add any file and you’ll see all changes listed in the Github App:</p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/5120/1*EEz8TIoxKPyOpvrhx1eSew.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2550/1*DmlefUroOYO12vBkFyoGTA.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>See the change? Now let’s <em>commit it</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*uzCcnHJWk6DSG3UjMETCAg.png" alt="Make sure you commit summary and message are descriptive" />
<cite><em>Make sure you commit summary and message are descriptive</em></cite></p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/4364/1*PjiXBjHqm_-ctU8xo35E2w.png" alt="Your commit history!" />
<cite><em>Your commit history!</em></cite></p>

<h3 id="one-important-caveat">One important caveat</h3>

<p>It’s important to notice that <em>your file changes will only be tracked after the file is commited for the first time</em>. Here’s a visual explanation:</p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2560/1*N6447osmv5GWDx_08V7FYA.png" alt="When a new file is added, Git still doesn't know about it. If you don't commit it…" />
<cite><em>When a new file is added, Git still doesn’t know about it. If you don’t commit it…</em></cite></p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2560/1*fgie9Er3HjLDCdQ1SVHl-w.png" alt="…any change you make will be lost! The previous line is gone and Git has no history saved." />
<cite><em>…any change you make will be lost! The previous line is gone and Git has no history saved.</em></cite></p>

<p>That’s one of the reasons it’s important to <em>constantly commit you work</em>, in small chunks — specially when you’re adding a new file. This way you make sure you can roll-back small changes if necessary and no work is lost.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-your-code">Sharing your code</h3>

<p>Once you’re done working, make sure you push your changes to Github using the <strong>Publish</strong> button on the top, so other collaborators can see them (and you have a backup in case something <em>bad</em> happens to your computer)! Conversely, to get the changes added by other collaborators from Github, just press <strong>Sync</strong>.</p>

<p>Want to see a previous state of your project? Just <strong>select a previous commit on your history</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s great to see your repository history growing, being sure that you can roll-back your changes anytime. It can (and probably will) get messy after a while, but knowing <em>it’s really hard</em> to screw things up is a reassuring way to work.</p>

<p><img src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/4364/1*xyeP9ysBbpYfsGnKdtTX1g.png" alt="Again: make sure your commit messages are as descriptive as possible" /><em>Again: make sure your commit messages are as descriptive as possible</em></p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h3>

<p>You may have realized the Github app shows an option called <strong>branches</strong>. Branches are a good way to modularize your project and make sure your code changes don’t conflict with other collaborators— but let’s leave this for another day ✨.</p>

<p>Using Git by yourself is already a great way to organize the way you code and make sure you can roll-back any unwanted changes. However, this is <em>really</em> just the beginning about Git. If you want further reference, here are some useful links:</p>

<p>This fantastic article is really helpful to navigate the dizziness of the design process for large multi-state applications.

  <p>If we’re able to identify why we trust Baskerville so much—the form, the weight, the context in which it’s presented—is it possible to design a font to achieve certain emotional effects?</p>

  <p>Bierut likens the reaction to typefaces to the way a voice can impact the way we perceive what’s been spoken. “In a way, typefaces are the graphic equivalent of the human voice, and each voice has a specific timbre and accent,” he says. “In my mind, Baskerville speaks with a calm, confidence-inspiring English accent, sort of like Colin Firth. No wonder it’s so trustworthy.”</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>So many good points on mission, values and building a company. Don’t let the title fool you, there’s no “management” advice in this list.</p>

<p>Some highlights:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s terribly difficult to manage unmotivated people. Make your job easier and don’t.</p>

  <p>Fire quickly. If you don’t fire bad performers fast, you’re at risk of losing your good performers. Don’t underestimate the effect bad performers have on good performers. Your team will likely move faster even with fewer bodies. Finally, firing for bad performance is easier than having to fire good people because you’ve run out of money, so fire the bad people before you have to fire the good people too.</p>

  <p>How you spend money is one of the biggest cultural signals you can send and is very hard to change. Where you spend money (and where you don’t) communicates what you think is important.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>I first found out about this project through their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/womenofsiliconvalley">Facebook page</a> and was glad when they started doing more in-depth interviews on Medium. The first is with Sophie Xie, product designer formely working on Facebook.</p>

<p>The interview says a lot about being a woman in tech, including things that sometimes go unnoticed for me as a man. If men want to change the subtle sexist behavior in their workspace, paying actual attention to what we’re doing is the first step (I guess).</p>

<p>By the way, as far as advice goes, you can’t really get more badass than this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What advice do you have for any girls pursuing a future in tech?<br />
<strong>tldr; I was successful in moments I quit being a nice girl and started becoming a monster.</strong></p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>Another entry in Josh Puckett’s exploration on future design tools for the workflow we need today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe one of the biggest flaws of today’s tools is their failure to allow designers to easily work with real data. (…)<br />
We spend an inordinate amount of time making our pixel-perfect fabrications. We then make sub-optimal decisions based on this, considering only our single, perfect state. We are surprised when our designs are implemented because we forgot to solve a variety of edge cases and problems. When we don’t work with real data, <em>we deceive ourselves</em>.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>I recently came across this past issue from the Mailchimp UX Newsletter and remembered how outstanding is their writing. If you haven’t subscribed yet, <a href="http://www.theuxnewsletter.com/">do it now</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights from the issue:</p>

<p>####<strong>Hiring</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s easy to hire someone who’s mediocre, but it’s really hard to fire them. Mediocre people are a drag on quality and moral, but they tend to do just enough good work to stick around. Managers have a tough time justifying letting them go because there’s no actionable offense. The scent of mediocrity on your team will also scare off talented candidates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>####<strong>Respect</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Respect between design and development is the most critical ingredient when making great products. It’s rare that respect between design and development happens organically. It has to be a core value of a company, demonstrated by leadership daily.</p>

  <p>Respect fosters a can-do attitude. Ideas are freely shared when they’re valued by colleagues, even when they’re not necessarily a winner. We could do a lot better if we started with <a href="http://www.jesterzimprov.com/fundamental-improv-principles/">“Yes, and..” instead of “No.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>####<strong>Team Size</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our UX team is tiny. Twelve of us do the research, design the UI, and build the front-end of the app. The engineering team we work with is equally small. But our size is not a shortcoming; it’s an advantage. Communication is easy when teams are small. Planning happens quickly so we can get back to making.</p>

  <p>Each little team has the autonomy to make decisions about their work, and when there’s uncertainty, they can go discuss with another autonomous team that can provide more definitive direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are traits I hope to find and foster at <a href="http://www.vtex.com/">VTEX</a>, with whom I just started working as a product designer. The fact that this article about UX was shared by a developer from our team tells me these methods are already under way for the most part <i class="twa twa-smile"></i></p>

  <p>We live in a world that is dynamic, designing and building software that lives on devices that are always changing and evolving.

  <p><strong>Design tools should have the same properties as the medium for which we are designing.</strong></p>

  <p>I started this site with animated gifs and splash pages while living in a cheap rent stabilized apartment. PageSpinner was my jam. I was in love with HTML and certain that the whole world was about to learn it, ushering in a new era of DIY media, free expression, peace and democracy and human rights worldwide. That part didn’t work out so well, although the kids prefer YouTube to TV, so that’s something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prototyping is the Wild West. Every team we met with uses a variety of prototyping tools, whether Pixate, Marvel, InVision, Flinto or others. There seems to be little if any standardization; as new tools emerge and teams find that they offer new advantages, designers readily adopt them and set others aside. There’s a feeling that this space has lots of growth and evolution ahead of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can you demonstrate the value of design games, or collaborative moodboard exercises? Or that it took six months of negotiating with dozens of facets of an organisation in order for a content strategy to be adopted? My advice would be to write a story. Show photographs of workshops. Demonstrate how you approach these things. List the methods you’ve used and those that have worked. List those that haven’t and the reasons why.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>Emily Guendelsberger goes undercover as an Uber driver in Philadelphia to figure out how deep the rabbit hole goes — and comes out of it with a 6000-word article, sprinkled with moments like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Passenger</strong>: So what’s Uber like? I hear you can make a ton of money!</p>

  <p><strong>Emily</strong>: Yeah, not really — when they take UberX into a new market like Philly, they start off by paying drivers a lot. So in the beginning, you get a lot of drivers who look like the drivers in Uber ads, like, suits and bottled water and no accents. And everyone gets the idea that Uber drivers have suits and make a ton of money. Then after a while, usually when a competitor comes in — you know Lyft just started up a couple weeks ago, right?</p>

  <p><strong>Passenger</strong>: Yeah …
<!--more-->
<strong>Emily</strong>: So then Uber cuts fares down by, like, a lot. Like, here, they just cut fares almost in half. So most of those initial drivers quit and are replaced by people willing to work for the lower amount, who are the same people who used to drive cabs. They’re just doing it for a new boss, for less money and no tips, and they’re carrying most of the liability themselves. But most riders never change that first impression that drivers make a lot of money.</p>

  <p><strong>Passenger</strong>: … Oh, uh, OK.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>Designer and artist Jaclyn Leneé is on a 100-day stretch doing a color palette everyday based on a different picture. See all of her palettes so far <a href="http://100daysofcolor.tumblr.com/?ref=danielfosco-linklist">on her Tumblr</a>.</p>

<p><em>~~Update~~</em></p>

<p>I reached out to Jaclyn <a href="https://twitter.com/jaclynlenee">on Twitter</a> to ask a couple of questions about her inspiration and feelings around the project — see below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What’s your process for coming up with the color palette for each photograph?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Jaclyn</strong>: I’m delighted by color in everyday life. I snap photos of subjects and textures I find beautiful, and pull colors from them.</p>

  <p><strong>How does this project relates to the way you use color in your design work?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Jaclyn:</strong> I frequently look online for color inspiration. Since I started this project, I’ve pulled from my own palettes. It is satisfying to design with my own color stories, rather than use a palette from Kuler, or elsewhere.</p>

  <p><strong>Do you expect things to get… repetitive by the 100th day? How do you look for new subjects and/or diff results?</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Jaclyn:</strong> I doubt it. Every image is different, the lighting different, the subject different. Endless possibilities. It is all about opening my eyes to the world around me. I take a lot of walks and keep my eyes peeled for color and texture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d like to thank Jaclyn for taking the time to answer these questions – great insights for anyone who wants to dive deeper into working with color <i class="twa twa twa-smiley"></i></p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>A primer to start writing CSS with BEM-style syntax by <a href="https://twitter.com/johan_ronsse">Johan Ronsse</a>. Good stuff, although I disagree with Johan when he says BEM is unnecessary for small and personal sites.</p>

<p>Personal project or not, writing CSS with BEM makes class-naming much more constrained (and well-documented), pushing you to write styling and markup in a more structured manner.</p>

<p>If you’ve never heard of BEM, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">this article</a> by CSS-Tricks is another great way to get started.</p>
