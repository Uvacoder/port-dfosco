  <p>I can’t deny that Slack has a nicer aesthetic than HipChat. It does look nice and it is fun to use. But here’s the thing — a lot of nicely designed products never take off or get noticed. Good design is not enough. There are so many pieces to consider and things you have to nail to get a product out ahead of the pack.</p>

  <p>Here’s my list.</p>

  <p>Newspapers, magazines, and television networks have dealt with this same issue for decades now.

  <p>Like a well-built home, great software focuses on giving its users hundreds of small, satisfying interactions. A great transition in a mobile app gives us the same feeling we get from using a well-made door handle on a solid oak door — you may not be able to put your finger on it, but man, does the house ever feel well built. Slack is really fun to use. It feels like a well-built house.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>Anil Dash shares what it’s like to have 500.000 Twitter followers without being an “actual celebrity”, dropping honest (but also hilarious) insights along the way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In all, aside from making people roll their eyes at me, the biggest impact of having this absurdly distended online network is that it makes my online life really weird. The weirdness is probably best demonstrated by a few of the recurring conversations that arise as a result:</p>

  <p><strong>“Yo, can you listen to my mixtape?”</strong> This is perhaps the most frequent side effect of having a lot of followers: People think there must be a reason people follow me, and assume I can do something for them as a result.</p>

  <p>(…)</p>

  <p><strong>“Kill yourself!”</strong> If you have a lot of followers online, and especially if you have the temerity to do so while being a woman and/or a minority of some sort , you’ll often just face waves of harassment and abuse, regardless of how innocuous your statements are. I’d talk more about this, and what the social networks could do to fix things, but then the GamerGate hordes will just show up and start sending threats again, and ughhhhh who has the time? (…)</p>

              <div class="card__description"><blockquote>
  <p><strong>Introducing Marvel UX Testing Tools Beta</strong><br />
We’re introducing some incredible tools that will allow you to get in-depth insights into how users interact with your prototypes including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Screen recordings of users moving through your prototype</li>
    <li>Indicators of where users tapped or clicked on each screen</li>
    <li>User reactions via audio and video feedback as they use your prototype</li>
    <li>Ability to share test results with your team and stakeholders</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For the past 3 years or so, a lot of prototyping tools popped up in the market, with Marvel and InVision being the leaders in the <em>export-your-png-assets-and-link-them-with-hotspots</em> category.</p>

<p>InVision has been paving the way with an extensive feature-set, being the first to offer Dropbox integration, automatic Sketch import, as well as the only one to add a <em>Google Hangouts</em> style live-call for remote user testing (it’s absolutely fantastic).</p>

<p>Marvel, on the other hand, has been on its own feature-spree the past few months: just after releasing prototype annotations and a Sketch import plugin, they now announced this beta for screen &amp; front-camera recording — which, without jumping to early conclusions, seems to be a killer feature.</p>

<p>Not only that, but this kind of feature ties in pretty closely to one of the most pressing needs of user testing: hell, if you’re giving me prototyping tools, might as well make it easier to record and evaluate my test results.</p>

<p>InVision, with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/invision-2">$35m in funding</a> rolling in since early 2012, had a good head start, but Marvel’s <em>mere</em> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/marvel">$900k</a> raised last year is clearly being put to good use by their team.</p>

<p>Considering the gigantic difference in funding they have, Marvel is kicking some serious Invision ass — while also raising the question of “perhaps you shouldn’t take <strong>35 million dollars</strong> in funding for a freaking prototyping tool?”.</p>

<p>But then again, who am I to say how one should or should not run their company? Although Fred Wilson provides a compelling argument for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_tjoQmf5g">why raising too much capital can be a bad thing</a>.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>Here‘s Evgeny Morozov (<a href="https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov">@evgenymorozov</a>) destroying Facebook and Google’s ambition to “spread connectivity across the globe” in a single blow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Facebook, Google’s closest competitor, pulls the same trick with connectivity. Its Internet.org initiative, which now operates in Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa, was ostensibly launched to promote digital inclusion and get the poor in the developing world online. Online they do get but it’s a very particular kind of “online”: Facebook and a few other sites and apps are free but users have to pay for everything else, often based on how much data their individual apps consume. As a result, few of these people – remember, we are talking about very poor populations – are likely to afford the world outside Facebook’s content empire.</p>

  <p>Here is the Varian rule at work again: on the face of it, the poor do get what the rich have already – internet connectivity. But the key difference is not hard to spot. Unlike the rich, who pay for their connectivity with their cash, the poor pay for it with their data – the data that Facebook would one day monetise in order to justify the entire Internet.org operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google‘s chief economist, Hal Varian, has such narrow-minded logic it could make someone think he’s overlooking some “details” in good faith, but when the “details” are the economic reality of 2/3 of the people in the globe, it makes very clear what’s behind the bullshit of his <span class="quote">“Luxury is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed”</span>: a desire to profit on top of people that have much less than you do, providing the same service the western-white-middle-class world already has, for much much more.</p>

  <p>When Tidal made its big media push at the end of March, the core message was clear: while other streaming music services like Spotify and Pandora pay a pittance to artists, Tidal offers musicians a better deal. Unfortunately, Tidal also opted to use super stars like Nicki Minaj and Beyonce as spokespersons for the app. The result was the ultimate mixed message: You should feel sorry about how little money Nicki makes.</p>

<p>Spot on analysis of why hardly anybody gives a crap about Tidal.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEsJqtiU-2A">humorous video</a> also drives the point home pretty well.</p>

  <p>Learning to design is, first of all, learning to see. Designers see more, and more precisely. This is a blessing and a curse—once we have learned to see design, both good and bad, we cannot un-see. The downside is that the more you learn to see, the more you lose your “common” eye, the eye you design for. […]</p>

  <p>This is why excellent designers do not just develop a sharper eye. They try to keep their ability to see things as a customer would. You need a design eye to design, and a non-designer eye to feel what you designed.</p>

<p>This small tidbit serves as the perfect example to his argument — overheard at a recent New York Times editorial meeting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] When the conversation turns to a vivid story from Liberia, where Ebola has overtaken a particular neighborhood in Monrovia, one editor proudly reports that she believes the Times is the only outlet with a reporter on the ground, which makes everyone happy until another editor says, “I think BuzzFeed actually has somebody there.” There is momentary silence.</p>

  <p>A bad survey won’t tell you it’s bad. It’s actually really hard to find out that a bad survey is bad — or to tell whether you have written a good or bad set of questions. […]</p>

  <p>Most seductively, surveys yield responses that are easy to count and counting things feels so certain and objective and truthful.</p>

  <p>Even if you are counting lies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surveys are usually the easiest way to gather “relevant” user feedback, but it’s easy to see how they can be used to cop out of <em>really</em> listening to your users.</p>

<p>Not saying surveys are now forever banned as good practices of user research, but when Erika Hall is saying stuff like this, you tread carefully at the very least.</p>

              <div class="card__description"><p>This week, a dress broke the internet (with the help of two llamas), yielding BuzzFeed <i class="twa twa twa-zap"></i><em>28 million</em><i class="twa twa twa-zap"></i> pageviews for a single article in less than 24 hours — and leaving traditional media shuffling their feet trying not to miss the tsunami.</p>

<p>Paul Ford <a href="https://medium.com/message/yes-to-the-dress-5ec06c06aca4">on Medium</a> tries to understand the reasons behind the dress’s success and the consequences it will bring to newsrooms around the globe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know from experience that Internet events like this have consequences. Meetings. Memos. Jealousy. Twenty-five million [at the time of publication] is a number to make an editorial director angry. […] <em>How do I get that? They’ll wonder. How do I get that sweet, sweet traffic? Why do those children get the traffic with frolic while my attempts to go viral fall flat at hundreds of thousands of impressions?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brian Morrissey echoes a similar feeling <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/its-white-and-gold-dummy/">on Digiday</a> and proclaims that “Buzzfeed won”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this game, BuzzFeed is winning. It must boggle the mind at traditional publishers that seemingly the entire Internet is talking about content that was created not by a seasoned reporter but a “community growth manager.” These so-called premium publishing brands will inevitably lose their pricing power in the ad market as they continue to copy BuzzFeed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a massive audience that‘s becoming bigger and wider every day, solid “news” coverage, an experimental app development team and a friggin’ movie studio, Buzzfeed is shaping up to be the media company of the future.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="https://twitter.com/cap/status/570775132697980928">they’re hiring</a>.</p>
