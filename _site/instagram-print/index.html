  <li><strong>Project:</strong> Mobile App Prototype for <a href="https://twitter.com/ga">@GENERAL ASSEMBLY</a></li>
  <li><strong>Role:</strong> UX Designer • Prototyper</li>
  <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2 Weeks • 3 Designers</li>
</ul>

<p>Instagram Print was a project for General Assembly’s UXDI class in partnership with Paz Perez and Christina Vu.</p>

<p>The client for this (fictional) brief was Instagram, who needed a way to diversify their revenue stream beyond advertising. For that, the requirement was a new printing feature directly integrated into the social network.</p>

<p>Our goal was to research and prototype a printing feature that would be integrated with the printing backend — which included credit card fulfillment and shipping to the user’s address.</p>

<section class="image-grid">

    <img src="/assets/img/intro_phone_2.png" alt="Phone 2" class="img-3col" />
    <img src="/assets/img/intro_phone_3.png" alt="Phone 3" class="img-3col" />
</section>

<p>The team for this project was really tight-knit, and the process was a big exercise in participatory design, from research to sketching, and user testing.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the project, my role shifted to assembling the app prototype using Axure, which you can play around with using <a href="http://y9d00x.axshare.com/home_feed.html">this link</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>

<h4 id="finding-our-starting-point">Finding our starting point</h4>

<p>When the project began, we set out to find a strong concept to guide our design process: one that would not only address user needs, but also differentiate the product from the several services that already print Instagram photos.</p>

<p>We set our core concept as an expansion of Instagram’s brand into the real world by connecting Instagram into the old way of sharing — through printing and gifting pictures.</p>

<p>One of our main differentiators from the competition would become the feature that allows you to print pictures where your friends had you tagged, and vice-versa.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<h4 id="competitive-analysis-user-research-and-affinity-mapping">Competitive analysis, User Research and Affinity Mapping</h4>

<p>We started the research phase by sending out a survey aiming to discover if potential users had the habit of printing pictures, their intentions when doing so and the frequency with which they printed photos.</p>

<p>The information gathered on the survey was complemented by a round of user interviews, where we went deeper into their photo printing needs and, more importantly, into their Instagram usage and how it relates to the information gathered so far.</p>

<p>The competitive research was extremely valuable, as it showed pain-points of competitors, and also highlighted one of our main value propositions: being able to print your friends’ pictures.</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/research_2.png" alt="Aggregating into personas" class="img-6col" />
</section>

<p>After research was done, we aggregated the results in an affinity map, to prioritize user needs and features, which was then used to build three personas for the project.</p>

<section class="persona-panel">
    <section class="persona">
    <img src="/assets/img/karen_round.png" alt="Personas" class="avatar-2col" />
    <legend><h4>Karen, 27</h4></legend>
    <blockquote>"Love my new apartment and my roommate, can’t wait to decorate the empty walls."
    </blockquote>
    </section>

<section class="persona">
    <img src="/assets/img/ashley_round.png" alt="Personas" class="avatar-2col" />
    <legend><h4>Ashley, 15</h4></legend>
    <blockquote>"I Instagram from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep."
    </blockquote>
</section>

<section class="persona">
    <img src="/assets/img/bill_round.png" alt="Personas" class="avatar-2col" />
    <legend><h4>Bill, 51</h4></legend>
    <blockquote>"I love taking pictures, but I love not wasting my time even more."
    </blockquote>
    </section>

<h4 id="storyboarding-and-user-flows">Storyboarding and User Flows</h4>

<p>The next step after the personas were set was to apply them to the product itself — or the idea that we had of the product by then. </p>

<p>A quick storyboarding session helped to shape the first user flows, that made clear how the user would move through the new feature in order to print pictures. </p>

<p>The flows were complemented by an overview of the new feature in comparison to the rest of app’s architecture.</p>

<h3 id="interaction-design">Interaction Design</h3>

<h4 id="sketching-testing-prototyping-testing">Sketching, Testing, Prototyping, Testing</h4>

<p>The earliest sketches were done in group on the whiteboard, as a way to get everyone on the same page and define initial expectations for the interface. </p>

<p>These were followed by several batches of rough wireframes that solidified the idea we had for the interface and allowed us to move forward to user testing.</p>

</section>

<p><img src="/assets/img/interaction_design_3.png" alt="Paper Prototyping" title="Paper Prototyping" /></p>

<p>Doing tests with paper prototypes allowed us to sketch, test and incorporate feedback much faster than any other alternative – using a printed-out phone mockup sped it up even more.</p>

<p>The interface and user flow for this project were challenging, specially around the product selection and checkout screens. Our first version had too much information per screen, in a way that mimicked a web interface, while further down the road we trimmed too much. Only through several iterations and a lot of testing we found the sweet spot.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/interaction_design_4.png" alt="User Testing" title="User Testing" /></p>

<p>When we had enough testing to move on to higher-def, Christina and Paz moved forward with the final mockups, while I prepared the interactive prototype using Axure – which included mimicking some of Instagram’s native interactions, as pictured below.</p>

<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>

<h4 id="design-at-close-quarters">Design at close quarters</h4>

<p>This project was intense, but the close-knit teamwork and the test-driven approach enabled us to achieve great results in a short ammount of time. </p>

<p>The intense testing rhythm allowed us to constantly fix our assumptions, while having the team in sync meant better feedback — and thus, a better design output.</p>

<p>It wasn’t without its hiccups, though — file organization became an issue at one point, something that could’ve been mitigated at the beginning of the project by stating a clear working structure and the tools to be used.</p>

<p>This is the kind of project you wish you had every week.</p>
