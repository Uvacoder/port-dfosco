<h4>Mobile App Prototype for <a href="https://twitter.com/ga">@GENERAL ASSEMBLY</a></h4>

<h4 id="weeks--3-designers">2 Weeks • 3 Designers</h4>

<p>Instagram Print was a project for General Assembly’s UXDI class in partnership with Paz Perez and Christina Vu.</p>

<p>In the brief, the client, Instagram, needed a way to diversify its revenue stream beyond advertising, and required a new printing service for the app.
Our goal was to research and prototype a printing service that would be integrated into Instagram’s main app, including credit card fulfillment and shipping to the user’s address.</p>

<p>The team for this project was really tight-knit, and the process was a big exercise in participatory design, from research to sketching and user testing and user testing. </p>

<p>Yes, it’s written twice — we tested a lot. </p>

<p>Towards the end of the project, my role shifted to assembling the App prototype using Axure. You can play with the prototype using the following link, or see the design process in detail after the break.</p>

<p>When the project began, we set out to find a strong concept to guide our design process. One that would not only address user needs, but also differentiate the product, as there are already lots of services used to print Instagram photos.</p>

<p>After a few braistoming sessions, we set our core concept as an expansion of Instagram’s brand into the real world by connecting Instagram into the old way of sharing — through printing and gifting pictures.</p>

<p>Thus, one of our main differentiators from the competition would become the feature that allows you to print pictures where your friends had you tagged, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>During the ideation process we considered a range of product types, but eventually dropped them in order to focus on an MVP that would add value to Instagram without overwhelming its users.</p>

<p>We also set on having the feature embeded on Instagram, instead of being a standalone app. Even though that could have made the app more complex (complexity which we ironed out), it also puts the new feature in front of their immense userbase.</p>

  <p>one of our main value propositions: being able to print your friend’s pictures, instead of your own only.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We started the research phase by sending out a survey aiming to discover if potential users had the habit of printing pictures, their intentions when doing so and the frequency with which they printed photos.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CJkRjL6.png" alt="Survey Result Screenshot" class="img-4col" /></p>

<p>The information gathered on the survey was complemented by a round of user interviews, where we went deeper into their photo printing needs and, more importantly, into their Instagram usage and how it relates to the information gathered so far.</p>

<p>The competitive research was also extremely valuable, as it showed one of the main issues with other printing apps was the interface — which did not lend itself to an easy mobile shopping experience. It also highlighted one of our main value propositions: being able to print your friend’s pictures, instead of your own only.</p>

<p>We ran all of the research results through an affinity map to prioritize user needs and features and organize them into logical units that responded to the project goals. This mapping was then used to build three personas for the project, which guided most of the actual product feature development.</p>

<h3 id="flows-sketches-and-wireframes">Flows, Sketches and Wireframes</h3>

<p>The next step after the personas were set was to apply them to the product itself — or the idea that we had of the product by then. </p>

<p>A quick storyboarding session helped to shape the first user flows, to make it clear for us how the user would move through the app in order to use the printing new service. The flows were followed by several batches of rough wireframes, that solidified the idea we had for the interface and allowed us to move forward to user testing.</p>

<h3 id="testing-testing-testing">Testing, testing, testing</h3>

<p>The interface for this project was definitely a challenge, as mobile shopping has its tricks. The first few attempts had too much information, in a way that mimicked a web interface, while further down the road we trimmed too much. Only through several iterations and a lot of testing we found the sweet spot.</p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CJkRjL6.png" alt="Rough Wireframes 2" class="img-3col" /></p>

<p>The earliest sketches were done in group on the whiteboard, as a way to get everyone on the same page and define initial expectations for the interface.</p>

<p>After that, a little trick helped speed up the process immensely – paper prototyping. Even though it’s frowned upon by some people, it allowed us to draw, test and repeat much faster than any other alternative.</p>

<p>And we used a printed-out phone mockup, which sped it up even more!</p>

<p>The next step was mocking up the final designs for testing a version closer to the final product, carried out by Christina and Paz. For that, they made a template to stay in line with Instagram’s visual design, as well as mantaining consistency between each other.</p>

<p>The last step of the process was prototyping the mockups using an Axure – a process that included mimicking Instagram interactions, as pictured below.</p>

<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<h3 id="keep-it-small">Keep it small</h3>

<p>The project was intense, and the close team-work and user-centered, test-driven approach enabled us to achieve a great result in a short ammount of time. The intensive testing rythm allowed us to constantly fix our assumptions, while the team was in sync the whole time. </p>

<p>It wasn’t without hiccups its hiccups, though – file organization became an issue at one point, and we almost lost some work that was already done. This is something that should’ve been mitigated at the beginning of the project by stating the file structure and tools to be used during the project.</p>

<p>Overall, this is the kind of project you wish you had every week.</p>
