        <title>Facebook isn’t a charity. The poor will pay by surrendering their data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s Evgeny Morozov (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov&quot;&gt;@evgenymorozov&lt;/a&gt;) destroying Facebook and Google’s ambition to “spread connectivity across the globe” in a single blow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Facebook, Google’s closest competitor, pulls the same trick with connectivity. Its Internet.org initiative, which now operates in Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa, was ostensibly launched to promote digital inclusion and get the poor in the developing world online. Online they do get but it’s a very particular kind of “online”: Facebook and a few other sites and apps are free but users have to pay for everything else, often based on how much data their individual apps consume. As a result, few of these people – remember, we are talking about very poor populations – are likely to afford the world outside Facebook’s content empire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here is the Varian rule at work again: on the face of it, the poor do get what the rich have already – internet connectivity. But the key difference is not hard to spot. Unlike the rich, who pay for their connectivity with their cash, the poor pay for it with their data – the data that Facebook would one day monetise in order to justify the entire Internet.org operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s chief economist, Hal Varian, has such narrow-minded logic it could make someone think he’s overlooking some “details” in good faith, but when the “details” are the economic reality of 2/3 of the people in the globe, it makes very clear what’s behind the bullshit of his &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“Luxury is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed”&lt;/span&gt;: a desire to profit on top of people that have much less than you do, providing the same service the western-white-middle-class world already has, for much much more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The numbers don’t lie: Jay-Z’s Tidal music service is already a spectacular flop</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Tidal made its big media push at the end of March, the core message was clear: while other streaming music services like Spotify and Pandora pay a pittance to artists, Tidal offers musicians a better deal. Unfortunately, Tidal also opted to use super stars like Nicki Minaj and Beyonce as spokespersons for the app. The result was the ultimate mixed message: You should feel sorry about how little money Nicki makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot on analysis of why hardly anybody gives a crap about Tidal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEsJqtiU-2A&quot;&gt;humorous video&lt;/a&gt; also drives the point home pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning to See</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Learning to design is, first of all, learning to see. Designers see more, and more precisely. This is a blessing and a curse—once we have learned to see design, both good and bad, we cannot un-see. The downside is that the more you learn to see, the more you lose your “common” eye, the eye you design for. […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is why excellent designers do not just develop a sharper eye. They try to keep their ability to see things as a customer would. You need a design eye to design, and a non-designer eye to feel what you designed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“See with one eye, feel with the other.” —Paul Klee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great read on the nature of design, from the folks over at IA.net&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Tweeting Child, or What I Learned about Social Media from a Five Year-Old</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His tweets can be cute, or goofy, or nonsensical, and always, always childish. They show the five year-old’s view of the touchscreen keyboard, the emoji set, the world captured by a phone camera and Google image search. They reveal some of his interests — sharks, himself and his family—and his mode of expression. […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Emoji are such a perfect medium for a child. […] “I like how beautiful they are,” says @beebaaahp. “Emoji is cool and it has amazing pictures. I like to type emoji a lot and be funny.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Hitting the Self-Destruct Button</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently nuked my personal website, partly inspired by Kevin M. Jackson’s &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; site above. This link blog is pretty much what’s left of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without getting too sentimental about it, the weight of keeping a &lt;em&gt;personal brand&lt;/em&gt; while selling myself as a designer and constantly worrying about presenting my old work was beginning to weight on my shoulders. Better to nuke the whole thing and start fresh &lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you’re in the midst of re-doing your portfolio, &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexcican.com/post/personal-websites/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Alex Cican might come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s relevant to note that my personal website is not my main source of work and/or revenue, &lt;em&gt;by any means&lt;/em&gt;. Needless to say, don’t destroy your portfolio site if your bread &amp;amp; butter depends on it. &lt;i class=&quot;twa twa-lg twa-boom&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;twa twa-lg twa-boom&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;twa twa-lg twa-boom&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why can&#39;t you track periods in Apple&#39;s Health app?</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I checked the documentation for HealthKit […] I was disappointed to find out that Apple did not include anything related to menstruation and the reproductive health of roughly half of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In case you’re wondering whether Health is only concerned with a few basics: Apple has predicted the need to input data about blood oxygen saturation, &lt;strong&gt;your daily molybdenum or pathogenic acid intake, cycling distance, number of times fallen and your electrodermal activity&lt;/strong&gt;, but nothing to do with recording information about your menstrual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
