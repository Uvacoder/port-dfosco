        <title>The UI Stack</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We think in flows, and we’re used to the physical world. When a door opens, it swings on an arc. When something travels, you can see it move. When something falls, you can see it bounce.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Awkward UI is when a product designer doesn’t take these things into account. That means that somewhere along the line, some rules have been broken.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The rules of the UI Stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fantastic article is really helpful to navigate the dizziness of the design process for large multi-state applications. It has some parallels with Everett McKay’s approach in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/UI-Communication-Intuitive-Interfaces-Effective/dp/0123969808/&quot;&gt;UI is Communication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can a Font Make Us Believe Something is True?</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we’re able to identify why we trust Baskerville so much—the form, the weight, the context in which it’s presented—is it possible to design a font to achieve certain emotional effects?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bierut likens the reaction to typefaces to the way a voice can impact the way we perceive what’s been spoken. “In a way, typefaces are the graphic equivalent of the human voice, and each voice has a specific timbre and accent,” he says. “In my mind, Baskerville speaks with a calm, confidence-inspiring English accent, sort of like Colin Firth. No wonder it’s so trustworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>“21 management things I learned at Imgur”</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So many good points on mission, values and building a company. Don’t let the title fool you, there’s no “management” advice in this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s terribly difficult to manage unmotivated people. Make your job easier and don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Fire quickly. If you don’t fire bad performers fast, you’re at risk of losing your good performers. Don’t underestimate the effect bad performers have on good performers. Your team will likely move faster even with fewer bodies. Finally, firing for bad performance is easier than having to fire good people because you’ve run out of money, so fire the bad people before you have to fire the good people too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How you spend money is one of the biggest cultural signals you can send and is very hard to change. Where you spend money (and where you don’t) communicates what you think is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>The Tiny Designer: How Designers and Non-Designers can get along</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each of us has a tiny designer somewhere inside&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We can all contribute to a design. You probably think that’s ridiculous, but that’s also the reason design projects can devolve so quickly: respect is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dual email course for designers and non-designers to improve understanding between both parts and make the design process less stressful and more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Women of Silicon Valley — Sophie Xie</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I first found out about this project through their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/womenofsiliconvalley&quot;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; and was glad when they started doing more in-depth interviews on Medium. The first is with Sophie Xie, product designer formely working on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview says a lot about being a woman in tech, including things that sometimes go unnoticed for me as a man. If men want to change the subtle sexist behavior in their workspace, paying actual attention to what we’re doing is the first step (I guess).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, as far as advice goes, you can’t really get more badass than this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What advice do you have for any girls pursuing a future in tech?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;tldr; I was successful in moments I quit being a nice girl and started becoming a monster.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Modern Design Tools: Using Real Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another entry in Josh Puckett’s exploration on future design tools for the workflow we need today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe one of the biggest flaws of today’s tools is their failure to allow designers to easily work with real data. (…)&lt;br /&gt;
We spend an inordinate amount of time making our pixel-perfect fabrications. We then make sub-optimal decisions based on this, considering only our single, perfect state. We are surprised when our designs are implemented because we forgot to solve a variety of edge cases and problems. When we don’t work with real data, &lt;em&gt;we deceive ourselves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Building a UX Team</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across this past issue from the Mailchimp UX Newsletter and remembered how outstanding is their writing. If you haven’t subscribed yet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theuxnewsletter.com/&quot;&gt;do it now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights from the issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hiring&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to hire someone who’s mediocre, but it’s really hard to fire them. Mediocre people are a drag on quality and moral, but they tend to do just enough good work to stick around. Managers have a tough time justifying letting them go because there’s no actionable offense. The scent of mediocrity on your team will also scare off talented candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;respect&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Respect between design and development is the most critical ingredient when making great products. It’s rare that respect between design and development happens organically. It has to be a core value of a company, demonstrated by leadership daily.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Respect fosters a can-do attitude. Ideas are freely shared when they’re valued by colleagues, even when they’re not necessarily a winner. We could do a lot better if we started with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jesterzimprov.com/fundamental-improv-principles/&quot;&gt;“Yes, and..” instead of “No.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;team-size&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our UX team is tiny. Twelve of us do the research, design the UI, and build the front-end of the app. The engineering team we work with is equally small. But our size is not a shortcoming; it’s an advantage. Communication is easy when teams are small. Planning happens quickly so we can get back to making.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Each little team has the autonomy to make decisions about their work, and when there’s uncertainty, they can go discuss with another autonomous team that can provide more definitive direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are traits I hope to find and foster at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vtex.com/&quot;&gt;VTEX&lt;/a&gt;, with whom I just started working as a product designer. The fact that this article about UX was shared by a developer from our team tells me these methods are already under way for the most part &lt;i class=&quot;twa twa-smile&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rapidly Animate with Keynote</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had heard before how far you can go with animations on Keynote, but this article just smashes the point through your skull — the two videos are super handy for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no way I’m not trying this for prototyping really soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On the topic of impostor syndrome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Web Developer Ray Bango talks about impostor syndrome and how the ever-increasing pace of web technologies makes us all feel like we’re in a hamster wheel. Make sure to watch the short video embeded in the article, really drives the point home!&lt;/p&gt;
