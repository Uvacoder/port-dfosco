#I’m <span class="accent">Daniel Fosco</span>, a designer based in Rio de Janeiro.

![Hi](http://i.imgur.com/GMkqnNn.jpg)

<em>Hi!</em>

###I design to solve problems for people.
These people may be your customers. Designing products and services that offer them real value is good for business.

###Learning is what I do best
But my current work is focused on <span class="accent">UX Design</span> and <span class="accent">Front-End Development</span>.

I'm available for new projects starting December 2014. Get in touch <a href="mailto:danielfosco@gmail.com?subject=Hello, let%E2%80%99s%20work%20together">here</a>.

###Book Publishing → Digital Product Design
 My background is in Book Publishing, but it turned out that the book industry wasn't not really for me. 

 After working in a digital publishing startup for a few years, I decided to go into Product Design to be involved with and *own* the design process from start to end.

For this, General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-immersive/new-york-city" target="_blank">10-week UX Design program</a> was instrumental to complement my UX skillset — as well as build relationships with other kickass designers.
