#I’m <span class="accent">Daniel Fosco</span>, a designer based in Rio de Janeiro.

![Yes, this one's me](http://i.imgur.com/GMkqnNn.jpg)

<em>Hi!</em>

###I design to solve problems for people.
I work with clients and startups to build design solutions that achieve user needs and business goals, delivering real-life value. 

My expertise is in <span class="accent">UX Design</span>, <span class="accent">Prototyping</span> & <span class="accent">Front-end Development</span>.

I'm available for new projects starting December 2014. [Get in touch](mailto:danielfosco@gmail.com?subject=Hello, let%E2%80%99s%20work%20together).

###Writing
I write on tech, design & development. Follow along at [blog.danielfos.co](http://blog.danielfos.co/).

###About
My background is in Book Publishing, but I gradually transitioned into Design.

After working in a digital publishing startup for a few years, I decided to fully shift to Digital Product Design — to be involved with and *own* the design process from start to end.

For this, General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-immersive/new-york-city" target="_blank">10-week UX Design program</a> I took in 2014 was instrumental to complement my UX skillset — as well as build relationships with other kickass designers.
