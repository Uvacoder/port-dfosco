#I’m <span class="accent">Daniel Fosco</span>, a designer based in Rio de Janeiro.

<em>Hi!</em>

###I design to solve problems for people.
These people may be your customers. Designing products and services that offer them real value is good for business.

###Learning is what I do best
But my specialties are <span class="accent">User Experience Design</span> & <span class="accent">Front-End Development</span>.


###Things I’ve done

###Book Publishing → Digital Product Design
 My background is in Book Publishing, but it turned out the book industry is not really for me. After working in a digital publishing startup in every possible position, I decided to go into Product Design, to be involved with and own the design process from start to end.

For this, General Assembly's [10-week UX Design program](https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-immersive/new-york-city) was essential to complete my UX skillset — as well as build relationships with several other kickass designers.
