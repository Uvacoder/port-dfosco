#Hi! 

#I’m <span class="accent">Daniel Fosco</span>, a designer based in Rio de Janeiro.

###I design to solve problems for people.
These people may be your customers. Making them happy is good business.

###Learning is what I do best
But my specialties are <span class="accent">User Experience Design</span> & <span class="accent">Front-End Development</span>.

###Book Publishing → Digital Product Design
I have a BA in Communications & Publishing from UFRJ.  

After leaving the publishing industry, took a 10-week UX Design program at General Assembly and rode into the sunset.
