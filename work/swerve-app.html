<ul>
<li><strong>Project:</strong> Mobile App Prototype for <a href="http://www.swervefitness.com/" target="_blank">Swerve Fitness</a></li>
<li><strong>Role:</strong> UX Designer • Prototyper</li>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2 ½ Weeks • 3 Designers • August 2014</li>
</ul>


<p>I acted in a team of three UX Designers in this mobile app prototype project, developed for the Swerve Fitness Studio as my final project in General Assembly&rsquo;s <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-immersive/new-york-city" target="_blank">UX Design Immersive Program</a>.</p>

<p>Swerve is a indoor cycling studio in Manhattan with a unique approach: their indoor bikes come equipped with a performance tracker that groups students into three teams that compete amongst each other every class.</p>

<p>Our focus with this prototype was to allow Swerve users to:</p>

<ul class="not-metadata">
    <li><span class="accent">Book classes with ease in their mobile phones.</span></li>
    <li><span class="accent">Visualize their performance stats in a dedicated interface.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>For this, we performed an industry-wide research that included interviews with fitness users and specialists, in-depth surveys, detailed analysis of the competition&rsquo;s offerings and <em>lots</em> of spinning classes.</p>

<p>This research was instrumental in guiding our iterative process of sketching, testing and prototyping — and resulted in a final product that addressed user needs and respected the existing systems at Swerve.</p>

<p>The final result of our work is the <strong>interactive prototype</strong> you can see below. The client also received a 16-page research report to be used as a boilerplate for future projects.</p>

<p>Finally, I can&rsquo;t help but mention that this project would never have been successful without the talented <a href="http://www.ashtonoconnor.com/" targe="_blank">Ashton O'Connor</a> and <a href="http://alfredoachecar.com/" target="_blank">Alfredo Achecar</a> on the team.</p>

<p>Much of the project&rsquo;s quality is due either to Ashton&rsquo;s obsessive UI Design skills and Alfredo&rsquo;s tireless leadership and research. The late nights and crazy hours were a pleasure with these two around.</p>
