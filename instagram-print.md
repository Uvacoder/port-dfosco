 - **Project:** Mobile App Prototype for [@GENERAL ASSEMBLY](https://twitter.com/ga)
 - **Role:** UX Designer • Prototyper
 - **Timeline:** 2 Weeks • 3 Designers
 

Instagram Print was a project for General Assembly's UXDI class in partnership with Paz Perez and Christina Vu.

The client for this (fictional) brief was Instagram, who needed a way to diversify their revenue stream beyond advertising. For that, the requirement was a new printing feature directly integrated into the social network.

Our goal was to research and prototype a printing feature that would be integrated with the printing backend — which included credit card fulfillment and shipping to the user’s address.

The team for this project was really tight-knit, and the process was a big exercise in participatory design, from research to sketching, and user testing.

Towards the end of the project, my role shifted to assembling the app prototype using Axure, which you can play around with using [this link](http://y9d00x.axshare.com/home_feed.html).

###Ideation

####Finding our starting point

When the project began, we set out to find a strong concept to guide our design process: one that would not only address user needs, but also differentiate the product from the several services that already print Instagram photos.

We set our core concept as an expansion of Instagram's brand into the real world by connecting Instagram into the old way of sharing — through printing and gifting pictures.

One of our main differentiators from the competition would become the feature that allows you to print pictures where your friends had you tagged, and vice-versa.

###Research

####Competitive analysis, User Research and Affinity Mapping

We started the research phase by sending out a survey aiming to discover if potential users had the habit of printing pictures, their intentions when doing so and the frequency with which they printed photos.

The information gathered on the survey was complemented by a round of user interviews, where we went deeper into their photo printing needs and, more importantly, into their Instagram usage and how it relates to the information gathered so far.

The competitive research was extremely valuable, as it showed pain-points of competitors, and also highlighted one of our main value propositions: being able to print your friends' pictures.

After research was done, we aggregated the results in an affinity map, to prioritize user needs and features, which was then used to build three personas for the project.

    <legend><h4>Karen, 27</h4></legend>
    <blockquote>"Love my new apartment and my roommate, can’t wait to decorate the empty walls."
    </blockquote>

    <legend><h4>Ashley, 15</h4></legend>
    <blockquote>"I Instagram from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep."

    <blockquote>"I love taking pictures, but I love not wasting my time even more."
    </blockquote>
    </section>
</section>

###Information Architecture

####Storyboarding and User Flows

The next step after the personas were set was to apply them to the product itself — or the idea that we had of the product by then. 

A quick storyboarding session helped to shape the first user flows, that made clear how the user would move through the new feature in order to print pictures. 

The flows were complemented by an overview of the new feature in comparison to the rest of app's architecture.

###Interaction Design

####Sketching, Testing, Prototyping, Testing

The earliest sketches were done in group on the whiteboard, as a way to get everyone on the same page and define initial expectations for the interface. 

These were followed by several batches of rough wireframes that solidified the idea we had for the interface and allowed us to move forward to user testing.

![Paper Prototyping](/assets/img/interaction_design_3.png "Paper Prototyping")

Doing tests with paper prototypes allowed us to sketch, test and incorporate feedback much faster than any other alternative -- using a printed-out phone mockup sped it up even more.

The interface and user flow for this project were challenging, specially around the product selection and checkout screens. Our first version had too much information per screen, in a way that mimicked a web interface, while further down the road we trimmed too much. Only through several iterations and a lot of testing we found the sweet spot.

When we had enough testing to move on to higher-def, Christina and Paz moved forward with the final mockups, while I prepared the interactive prototype using Axure -- which included mimicking some of Instagram's native interactions, as pictured below.

###Key Takeaways

####Design at close quarters

This project was intense, but the close-knit teamwork and the test-driven approach enabled us to achieve great results in a short ammount of time. 

The intense testing rhythm allowed us to constantly fix our assumptions, while having the team in sync meant better feedback — and thus, a better design output.

It wasn't without its hiccups, though — file organization became an issue at one point, something that could've been mitigated at the beginning of the project by stating a clear working structure and the tools to be used.

This is the kind of project you wish you had every week.
