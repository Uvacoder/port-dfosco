I acted in a team of three UX Designers in this mobile app prototype project, developed for the Swerve Fitness Studio as my final project in General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-immersive/new-york-city" target="_blank">UX Design Immersive Program</a>.

Swerve is a indoor cycling studio in Manhattan with a unique approach: their indoor bikes come equipped with a performance tracker that groups students into three teams that compete amongst each other every class.

Our focus with this prototype was to allow Swerve users to:

 - **Book classes with ease in their mobile phones**
 - **Visualize their performance stats in a dedicated interface**

For this, we performed an industry-wide research that included interviews with fitness users and specialists, in-depth surveys, detailed analysis of the competition's offerings and *lots* of spinning classes.

This research was instrumental in guiding our iterative process of sketching, testing and prototyping — and resulted in a final product that addressed user needs and respected the existing systems at Swerve.

The final result of our work is the **interactive prototype** you can see below. The client also received a 16-page research report to be used as a boilerplate for future projects.

Finally, I can't help but mention that this project would never have been successful without the talented <a href="http://www.ashtonoconnor.com/" targe="_blank">Ashton O'Connor</a> and <a href="http://alfredoachecar.com/" target="_blank">Alfredo Achecar</a> on the team.

Much of the project's quality is due either to Ashton's obsessive UI Design skills and Alfredo's tireless leadership and research. The late nights and crazy hours were a pleasure with these two around.
