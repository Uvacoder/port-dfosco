I recently started playing around with [Framer.js](framerjs.com), a JS framework to build high-definition mobile prototypes.

Framer uses CoffeeScript, which is easier on the eyes than vanilla JS, but still got quite the learning curve — you still have to know what you're doing to pull out the crazy stuff. 

Regardless, it's _really_ fun to play with. This is what I came up with so far.

<div class="framer-item">
    <img src="" alt="" class="framer-item__thumb">
    
    <h3 class="framer-item__title">
        <a href="#" class="framer-item__url">Pulse</a>
    </h3>

    <p class="framer-item__description">
        A pulsing circle — a test to get used to the basic features of Framer
    </p>

    <span class="framer-item__github-link">See the code on GitHub</span>
</div>

<div class="framer-item">
    <img src="" alt="" class="framer-item__thumb">
    
    <h3 class="framer-item__title">
        <a href="#" class="framer-item__url">iOS Notification</a>
    </h3>

    <p class="framer-item__description">
        A small prototype that simulates an iOS Notification. Notification sound was supposed to be working <i class="twa twa-weary"></i>
    </p>

    <span class="framer-item__github-link">See the code on GitHub</span>
</div>
