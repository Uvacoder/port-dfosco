Great article by Andrew Wilkinson about the importance of building a small-scale business that provides value to a small number of customers.

On the same note, [Jason Cohen's article](http://blog.asmartbear.com/unsustainable-companies.html) from 2012 highlights the perils of "successful unsustainable" companies, while [Fred Destin's article](http://freddestin.com/2013/11/snapchat-revenues-debate.html) from 2013 does pretty much the opposite, in a fantastic defense of Snapchat and similar companies with no revenue or an apparent business model.
