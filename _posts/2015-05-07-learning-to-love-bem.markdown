A primer to start writing CSS with BEM-style syntax by [Johan Ronsse](https://twitter.com/johan_ronsse). Good stuff, although I disagree with Johan when he says BEM is unnecessary for small and personal sites. 

Personal project or not, writing CSS with BEM makes class-naming much more constrained (and well-documented), pushing you to write styling and markup in a more structured manner. 

If you've never heard of BEM, [this article](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) by CSS-Tricks is another great way to get started.
