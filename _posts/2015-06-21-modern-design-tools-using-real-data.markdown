Another entry in Josh Puckett's exploration on future design tools for the workflow we need today.


> I believe one of the biggest flaws of today’s tools is their failure to allow designers to easily work with real data. (...)  
> We spend an inordinate amount of time making our pixel-perfect fabrications. We then make sub-optimal decisions based on this, considering only our single, perfect state. We are surprised when our designs are implemented because we forgot to solve a variety of edge cases and problems. When we don’t work with real data, _we deceive ourselves_.
