>**Introducing Marvel UX Testing Tools Beta**  
>We’re introducing some incredible tools that will allow you to get in-depth insights into how users interact with your prototypes including:
>  
> - Screen recordings of users moving through your prototype  
> - Indicators of where users tapped or clicked on each screen  
> - User reactions via audio and video feedback as they use your prototype  
> - Ability to share test results with your team and stakeholders  

For the past 3 years or so, a lot of prototyping tools popped up in the market, with Marvel and InVision being the leaders in the _export-your-png-assets-and-link-them-with-hotspots_ category. 

InVision has been paving the way with an extensive feature-set, being the first to offer Dropbox integration, automatic Sketch import, as well as the only one to add a _Google Hangouts_ style live-call for remote user testing (it's absolutely fantastic).

Marvel, on the other hand, has been on its own feature-spree the past few months: just after releasing prototype annotations and a Sketch import plugin, they now announced this beta for screen & front-camera recording — which, without jumping to early conclusions, seems to be a killer feature.

Not only that, but this kind of feature ties in pretty closely to one of the most pressing needs of user testing: hell, if you're giving me prototyping tools, might as well make it easier to record and evaluate my test results.

InVision, with [$35m in funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/invision-2) rolling in since early 2012, had a good head start, but Marvel's _mere_ [$900k](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/marvel) raised last year is clearly being put to good use by their team.

Considering the gigantic difference in funding they have, Marvel is kicking some serious Invision ass — while also raising the question of "perhaps you shouldn't take **35 million dollars** in funding for a freaking prototyping tool?".

But then again, who am I to say how one should or should not run their company? Although Fred Wilson provides a compelling argument for [why raising too much capital can be a bad thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_tjoQmf5g).
