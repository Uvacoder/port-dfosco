>I met Maurice on February 22nd, 2014, at a high school hackathon. [...]
>
>Later that night, I received a phone call from him, and he asked if I would be able to teach him how to code. I love teaching, and Maurice seemed like a nice kid, so I offered to help. He immediately said, “okay, go,” and awaited instruction. I explained that I wouldn’t be able to teach him over the phone, but then I found out that **he didn’t have internet at home**.

It's really easy to overlook these “details”, specially with the president of Y Combinator (the most prestigious accelerator in the US) tweeting stuff like this:
