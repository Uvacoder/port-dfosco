I first found out about this project through their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/womenofsiliconvalley) and was glad when they started doing more in-depth interviews on Medium. The first is with Sophie Xie, product designer formely working on Facebook.

The interview says a lot about being a woman in tech, including things that sometimes go unnoticed for me as a man. If men want to change the subtle sexist behavior in their workspace, paying actual attention to what we're doing is the first step (I guess).

By the way, as far as advice goes, you can't really get more badass than this:

> What advice do you have for any girls pursuing a future in tech?  
> **tldr; I was successful in moments I quit being a nice girl and started becoming a monster.**
