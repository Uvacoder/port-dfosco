I recently nuked my personal website, partly inspired by Kevin M. Jackson‘s _new_ site above. This link blog is pretty much what’s left of it.

Without getting too sentimental about it, the weight of keeping a _personal brand_ while selling myself as a designer and constantly worrying about presenting my old work was beginning to weight on my shoulders. Better to nuke the whole thing and start fresh <sup><b>1</b></sup>.

By the way, if you're in the midst of re-doing your portfolio, [this article](http://alexcican.com/post/personal-websites/) by Alex Cican might come in handy.

<sub>**1.** It‘s relevant to note that my personal website is not my main source of work and/or revenue, _by any means_. Needless to say, don’t destroy your portfolio site if your bread & butter depends on it. <i class="twa twa twa-boom"></i> <i class="twa twa twa-boom"></i> <i class="twa twa twa-boom"></i></sub>
