This week, a dress broke the internet (with the help of two llamas), yielding BuzzFeed <i class="twa twa twa-zap"></i>_28 million_<i class="twa twa twa-zap"></i> pageviews for a single article in less than 24 hours — and leaving traditional media shuffling their feet trying not to miss the tsunami.

Paul Ford [on Medium](https://medium.com/message/yes-to-the-dress-5ec06c06aca4) tries to understand the reasons behind the dress's success and the consequences it will bring to newsrooms around the globe:

>I know from experience that Internet events like this have consequences. Meetings. Memos. Jealousy. Twenty-five million [at the time of publication] is a number to make an editorial director angry. [...] _How do I get that? They’ll wonder. How do I get that sweet, sweet traffic? Why do those children get the traffic with frolic while my attempts to go viral fall flat at hundreds of thousands of impressions?_

Brian Morrissey echoes a similar feeling [on Digiday](http://digiday.com/publishers/its-white-and-gold-dummy/) and proclaims that “Buzzfeed won”:

> In this game, BuzzFeed is winning. It must boggle the mind at traditional publishers that seemingly the entire Internet is talking about content that was created not by a seasoned reporter but a “community growth manager.” These so-called premium publishing brands will inevitably lose their pricing power in the ad market as they continue to copy BuzzFeed.

With a massive audience that‘s becoming bigger and wider every day, solid “news” coverage, an experimental app development team and a friggin’ movie studio, Buzzfeed is shaping up to be the media company of the future.
