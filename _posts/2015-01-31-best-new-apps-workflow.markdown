Released late last year, I ended up downloading Workflow this week. **It's mindblowing**. Long story short, it allows you to make custom apps straight from your iPhone. If you were looking to have some (nerdy) fun with your iOS device, this is it. 

[Make a run for the AppStore while it's 60% off](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334).
