> We’re been working towards this “when you walk around, your phone should buzz you and tell you about the awesome things you don’t yet know about” vision of the future for a long time. Honestly, we were thinking about this stuff with Dodgeball @ Google, and were motivated to build Foursquare because we wanted this to exist so badly. So, want a brief history of how we got from 2009 -> 2015?

Buried deep inside a Product Hunt discussion thread, Foursquare founder [Dennis Crowley](https://twitter.com/dens) gives a recap of Foursquare's design history and lays out the vision behind their Apple Watch app.

Essential reading for anyone looking to understand the long-term evolution of a product.
