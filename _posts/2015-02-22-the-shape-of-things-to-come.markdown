The New Yorker profiles Jony Ive — a good read, albeit a bit long. Worth skimming at least.

Lots of insight on Apple's design process, but this quote takes the cake for _most amusing_:

>Ive once sat next to J. J. Abrams at a boozy dinner party in New York, and made what Abrams recalled as “very specific” suggestions about the design of lightsabres.
>
>“I thought it would be interesting if it were less precise, and just a little bit more spitty.” A redesigned weapon could be “more analog and more primitive, and I think, in that way, somehow more ominous.”
