I know I‘ve been heavy on the _Buzzfeed_ bandwagon lately, but Ben Thompson’s analysis is too good an opportunity to pass up. Seriously, [follow this guy](https://twitter.com/monkbent).

This small tidbit serves as the perfect example to his argument — overheard at a recent New York Times editorial meeting:

>[...] When the conversation turns to a vivid story from Liberia, where Ebola has overtaken a particular neighborhood in Monrovia, one editor proudly reports that she believes the Times is the only outlet with a reporter on the ground, which makes everyone happy until another editor says, “I think BuzzFeed actually has somebody there.” There is momentary silence.
