Another great entry on FROONT's gif-powered design guides, this time on the basics of user research. Their previous entries on [positioning in web design](http://blog.froont.com/positioning-in-web-design/) and [the history of the web](http://blog.froont.com/brief-history-of-web-design-for-designers/) are pretty neat too.
