>A bad survey won’t tell you it’s bad. It’s actually really hard to find out that a bad survey is bad — or to tell whether you have written a good or bad set of questions. [...]

>Most seductively, surveys yield responses that are easy to count and counting things feels so certain and objective and truthful.

>Even if you are counting lies.
